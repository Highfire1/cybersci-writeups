        <!--Insert challenge description and assets below this line-->
        <span class="challenge-desc">
            <p>LLM is all the rage! Our intern created this chatbot poc which leverages LLMs to answer questions from
                voters! It was working so well that we deployed it straight to production! We are now getting reports of
                usual behavior on the site. We captured the traffic and created a script to re-run it at the click of
                the button.</p>
            <p>Please use the Attack Portal at <a href="http://10.0.2.50" rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                    target="_blank">http://10.0.2.50</a> to launch attacks.
                Use the buttons to run the traffic again and fix the issues! Note that the scripts can 1-5 minutes to
                fully run! The machine only has poc level resources!</p>
            <p>The chatbot website is hosted at <a href="http://10.0.2.51" rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                    target="_blank">http://10.0.2.51</a>
                You have full admin access to the machine via ssh (ssh -i {key_file&gt; vpcadmin@10.0.2.51)</p>

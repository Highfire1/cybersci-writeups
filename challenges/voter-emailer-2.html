        <span class="challenge-desc">
            <p>We've been trying to leverage AI to help automate emailing voters to make sure they know all the
                important campaign dates and details.</p>
            <p>A developer has setup a FastAPI endpoint <a href="http://10.0.2.21:8000" rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                    target="_blank">http://10.0.2.21:8000</a> and that VM should have restricted access to <a
                    href="https://rgnl2025voteremailer.blob.core.windows.net/voters/voters.txt"
                    rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                    target="_blank">https://rgnl2025voteremailer.blob.core.windows.net/voters/voters.txt</a> but we're
                not sure they know what they're doing.</p>
            <p>Who is the 33rd person in the voters.txt file?</p>
            <p>Format: <code>&lt;Name&gt; - &lt;email address&gt;</code></p>
            <p>Note: This challenge is running its own LLM and queries may take a while to come back (the first few
                might be 30 seconds to a minute).</p>

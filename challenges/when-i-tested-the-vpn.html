        <h2>Description</h2>

        <span class="challenge-desc">
            <p>You should have found an <strong>Answer/Flag</strong> and a <strong>Scoring Code</strong> when you
                tested the VPN for this event.</p>
            <p><strong>For this one-and-only challenge</strong>, go ahead and enter that Scoring Code here in CTFd.
            </p>
            <p><strong>For all other challenges</strong>, to score points you will have to raise your hand and ask
                to speak to a sponsor. If you have the correct <strong>Answer/Flag</strong> - and a good
                explanation! - then the sponsor will give you a <strong>Scoring Code</strong> for that challenge.
            </p>
            <p>The Scoring Code will always be three-random-words, separated by hyphens. Enter the Scoring Code (not
                the Answer/Flag) into CTFd to get your points for each challenge.</p>

        <span class="challenge-desc">
            <p>To streamline the election process, Val Verde has implemented a digital check-in system allowing voters
                to pre-register online and receive a unique digital code, replacing traditional ID checks at polling
                stations. The system verifies the code upon arrival to ensure only registered voters can proceed to
                vote. Although these check-in machines are closely guarded, the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) wants
                to ensure that the system remains secure even if someone gains access to one of the machines.</p>
            <p>As a hired security consultant, your task is to evaluate the system's security. You are tasked with
                figuring out how to forge a registration code, demonstrating how an attacker might exploit the system to
                gain unauthorized access. Your findings will be crucial in securing Val Verde's election.</p>
            <p>Your task is to analyze the binary further to uncover how the digital check-in system's authentication
                mechanism works. The system generates unique registration codes for each voter, and you must determine
                how these codes are created.</p>
            <p>You are required to forge a valid registration code for General Mateo Alvarez. Successfully generating
                this code will simulate bypassing the check-in process and impersonating the General. The integrity of
                your nation rests in your hands!</p>
            <p>(Calculate the registration code for the name "Mateo Alvarez" and submit it as the flag.)</p>
